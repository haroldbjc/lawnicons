**Lawnicons** is an icon pack developed by the Lawnchair team and supported by our community.
Originally an addon for Lawnchair 12 Alpha 5 and above to implement themed icons, it can now be used on many launchers.

Lawnicons is best used [on Lawnchair 12.1 or Lawnchair 14 Beta 2](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/releases). You can enable themed icons on Lawnchair by going to `Home Settings → General → Icon Style → Themed Icons → "Home screen" or "Home screen and App Drawer"`.
